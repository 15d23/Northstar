# Northstar

Northstar is a modding framework client that allows users to host their own Titanfall 2 servers using custom scripts and assets to create custom content, as well as being able to host vanilla content.

# Manual Install

Firstly, note that the Northstar client is only available on PC and
requires you to **both own the game and have it installed.**

1.  Download the zip with the "Manual Download" button
2.  Copy the files from inside the "Northstar" folder from the zip to your game folder. This can vary depending on whether you purchased the game off Steam or Origin, and if you set a custom folder for game installs.
    - **For Steam** - Right click _Titanfall 2 \> Properties \> Local Files \> Browse_  
      Usually: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Titanfall2`
    - **For Origin** - To find the location of your Origin library go to _Origin -\> Application Setting -\> Installs & Saves -\> On your Computer -\> Game Library Location_  
      Go to the directory mentioned there using File Explorer and open the `Titanfall2` folder.  
      Usually: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\Titanfall2`
    - **For EA App** - To find the location of your EA library go to _Settings -\> Download_  
      Go to the directory under "Install location" using File Explorer and open the `Titanfall2` folder.  
      Usually: `C:\Program Files\EA Games\Titanfall2`
3.  Launch `NorthstarLauncher.exe` to start Northstar
    - After launching for the first time, you'll be greeted with a popup requesting to authenticate to the master server. Click Yes (This can be changed in the mods menu later if desired)
4.  Select _Launch Northstar_
5.  From the multiplayer menu, you can use the server browser to select and join any of the public community hosted servers.
